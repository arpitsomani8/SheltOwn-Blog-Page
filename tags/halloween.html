                      The day I stepped into my college&#x27;s &#x27;girls
                      hostel&#x27;, I never knew I would end up with a bag full
                      of memories of every sort. Specially the strange, dramatic
                      yet funniest Halloween ever. So, the day was not very
                      different, just usual like any other day. Our batch of
                      second year students were barred from attending the hostel
                      Diwali function, don&#x27;t even ask why, we were not very
                      famous for good conduct moreover the whole batch stuck
                      together so eventually no one from second year went apart
                      from participants and few others. We did miss on the
                      function but our batch decided to celebrate our own
                      Halloween and we planned that at midnight all of us would
                      get dressed up and go to each and every room and do the
                      usual trick or treat. That is the time when we all got
                      excited with the plan and everyone started planning on
                      getting dressed up. Though my roommates and I were not
                      that interested but looking at everyone getting all
                      dressed up we planned to get ready and go with others.
                      Everyone got dressed up, a girl got too innovative and got
                      dressed up as Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Caribbean
                      and she even had an alcohol bottle, don&#x27;t ask where
                      she got it from, we were in hostel, I hopes that explains
                      itself, one got dressed up like Annabelle and I must say
                      it was pretty much on point. Similarly, there were many
                      who could pass the best ghost bar easily. I had no idea
                      what to dress up like I slowly started putting make up and
                      ended up looking like the giant in Jajantaram Mamantaram.
                      Then I realized what a terrible idea it was when I could
                      have just put some kajal and looked like I got punched,
                      but no what a decision I taken lie any other life
                      decisions of mine, there was no going back because there
                      were others who looked scarier than me so I had company
                      and didn&#x27;t feel sorry. We all took a group picture
                      till then almost everyone on the first floor, our seniors
                      and our batch mates had seen us and a ruckus had already
                      been initiated by our batch. Few of our batch mates were
                      not interested so they decided to stay in their own rooms.
                      Then we went down stairs to our juniors we got split into
                      two parties few went to rooms on one side of the lobby and
                      few went towards the rooms near the mess area. That is
                      when things went out of control. We all got driven in the
                      moment and there was a huge commotion. All of us were
                      shouting, laughing running here and there. Then the hostel
                      Superintendent entered through the door, which connected
                      the passage for first year&#x27;s rooms and her room. We
                      were all tensed and few rushed upstairs to their rooms and
                      few were left behind in the rooms of our juniors. Everyone
                      switched their lights off and pretended to be asleep.
                      Wondering where I was? Yes, I was downstairs in one of the
                      junior&#x27;s rooms with few of my friends. The
                      superintendent slowly walked up to the first floor and we
                      were all scared to be caught in such weirdly dressed up
                      manner. We slowly went up through the back door passage
                      and washed our faces and went to our room but
                      unfortunately she had caught few of us and was asking them
                      whoever was involved but didn&#x27;t get caught, so I had
                      to go, I knew no one would have told her but we had to
                      face the consequences together. The Superintendent clicked
                      our pictures as a proof and that was when I came to know
                      she had found the alcohol bottle near the stair case and
                      on top of one issue about creating a huge disturbance in
                      midnight, we were also caught for a bigger monkey
                      business. Though one of us was spontaneous enough to tell
                      that they had brought the empty bottle to paint for some
                      project yet we weren&#x27;t that lucky so she didn&#x27;t
                      buy our full proof excuse. She told us that she would
                      inform this to the college director and we would have to
                      write an application saying sorry and that if anything
                      else would happen further we would be expelled from the
                      hostel and we would have to call our local guardians and
                      she wouldn&#x27;t sign our clearance for admit card until
                      we did as told. It was like a cloud of sadness had fell on
                      everyone. All of us told our parents then itself before it
                      could get any worse, luckily our parents and local
                      guardians didn&#x27;t take it so badly so we were a bit
                      relieved. But that day will always be remembered by all of
                      us.
