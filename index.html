                  people of all age groups are great victims of depression. It
                  is also stated that women suffer more than men. If the victims

                  phone call or online intending to perceive the reasons as to
                  what caused the sufferer to reach such states. EXERCISE Mild
                  depression can be cured with the help exercise. Exercise
                  regularly helps to escalate endorphin levels in the body

                  What is real ? Is anything real at all ? Is reality a myth or
                  myth a reality ? Nothing is real and yet everything is real.
                  Sounds paradoxical ? Are you really reading this article or is
                  it a naive illusion ? Pay close attention to every detail if
                  possible ; don&#x27;t let this moment fool you into believing
                  that it is real. Because, it&#x27;s not real ! If it were real
                  you would be scrolling down your Instagram feed, envying your
                  peers, belittling your self-worth, berating God for being
                  indifferent to your suffering and procrastinating, because
                  that&#x27;s your reality- your virtual reality ! Isn&#x27;t it
                  ? We have accepted virtual reality to be our &#x27; ACTUAL
                  REALITY&#x27; ; so can we say that WHATEVER WE CHOOSE TO
                  ACCEPT BECOMES OUR REALITY ? We all have ideal versions of
                  reality in our head. Actually, reality and myth are relative
                  concepts. An idea, event, concept or product can be both real
                  and myth at the same time. It only depends on the frame of
                  reference we are looking from. So, when we talk about the
                  great epic poem , the MAHABHARATA, which is one of the two
                  major Sanskrit epics of ancient India, the other being the
                  Ramayaṇa, with more than 74,000 verses, plus long prose
                  passages, or some 1.8 million words in total, it is the
                  longest epic poem in the world (roughly 10 times the size of
                  the Iliad and Odyssey taken together) and continuous
                  recitation would take close to two weeks, It would be better
                  to take an ambivalent stand. The historicity of the
                  Kurukshetra War is debatable. Many historians roughly estimate
                  the date of the Kurukshetra war to Iron Age India of the 10th
                  century BCE. The setting of the epic has a historical
                  precedent in Iron Age (Vedic) India, where the Kuru kingdom
                  was the center of political power during roughly 1200 to 800
                  BCE Puranic literature presents genealogical lists associated
                  with the Mahābhārata narrative. Now, if we just do away with
                  the facts we must appreciate the relevance of this epic poem
                  even in 21st century. The central conflict of Mahabharatha was
                  vengeance. The Pandavas wanted to avenge Draupadi&#x27;s
                  humiliation &quot;cheer haran&quot;. The war was a way of
                  their redemption- a desperate attempt to regain their lost
                  souls. All the lessons by Krishna to Arjun are so relevant
                  today that we consider them as guides - like the pole star to
                  a lost traveller. The central theme of the Mahabharata are
                  envy, lust, greed , quest for power, betrayal and over
                  ambition. Such evils plague our society even today. In the
                  Mahabharata, the kins are always at daggers drawn and become
                  blood thirsty. Today, the kins brew bad blood against one
                  other too. Betrayal and greed ruin lives even today. So, we
                  can easily draw parallels between two diametrically opposite
                  timelines, can&#x27;t we ? Now, we can construct an
                  interesting theory though. Maybe, the Mahabharata happens all
                  around us, everytime ! Maybe, it is happening now, while this
                  sentence is being written. Maybe, it is a microcosm of those
                  multiverses which we know nothing about ! Maybe a small
                  version of the MAHABHARATA happens in every household ! But ,
                  of course , we are bluntly oblivious of its presence because
                  we are too busy fighting about the most coveted &#x27;reality
                  vs myth debate&#x27; about the Mahabharata.

                  Kurukshetra War is debatable. Many historians roughly estimate
                  the date of the Kurukshetra war to Iron Age India of the 10th
                  century BCE. The setting of the epic has a historical
                  precedent in Iron Age (Vedic) India, where the Kuru kingdom
                  was the center of political power during roughly 1200 to 800
                  BCE Puranic literature presents genealogical lists associated
                  with the Mahābhārata narrative. Now, if we just do away with
                  the facts we must appreciate the relevance of this epic poem
                  even in 21st century. The central conflict of Mahabharatha was
                  vengeance. The Pandavas wanted to avenge Draupadi&#x27;s
                  humiliation &quot;cheer haran&quot;. The war was a way of
                  their redemption- a desperate attempt to regain their lost
                  souls. All the lessons by Krishna to Arjun are so relevant
                  today that we consider them as guides - like the pole star to
                  a lost traveller. The central theme of the Mahabharata are
                  envy, lust, greed , quest for power, betrayal and over
                  ambition. Such evils plague our society even today. In the
                  Mahabharata, the kins are always at daggers drawn and become
                  blood thirsty. Today, the kins brew bad blood against one
                  other too. Betrayal and greed ruin lives even today. So, we
                  can easily draw parallels between two diametrically opposite
                  timelines, can&#x27;t we ? Now, we can construct an
                  interesting theory though. Maybe, the Mahabharata happens all
                  around us, everytime ! Maybe, it is happening now, while this
                  sentence is being written. Maybe, it is a microcosm of those
                  multiverses which we know nothing about ! Maybe a small
                  version of the MAHABHARATA happens in every household ! But ,
                  of course , we are bluntly oblivious of its presence because
                  we are too busy fighting about the most coveted &#x27;reality
                  vs myth debate&#x27; about the Mahabharata.
