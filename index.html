                      most of the people but the victim. Every disease has
                      therapeutics but for depression, the major medication is
                      love and support. As stated by the World Health
                      Organization, more than 264 million people of all age
                      groups are great victims of depression. It is also stated
                      that women suffer more than men. If the victims reach
                      their worst stage it can prove to be hazardous leading to
                      suicide. Depression is said to have soared to great
                      heights during the pandemic. Depression also is known as

                      where he talks over the phone call or online intending to
                      perceive the reasons as to what caused the sufferer to
                      reach such states. EXERCISE Mild depression can be cured

                      What is real ? Is anything real at all ? Is reality a myth
                      or myth a reality ? Nothing is real and yet everything is
                      real. Sounds paradoxical ? Are you really reading this
                      article or is it a naive illusion ? Pay close attention to
                      every detail if possible ; don&#x27;t let this moment fool
                      you into believing that it is real. Because, it&#x27;s not
                      real ! If it were real you would be scrolling down your
                      Instagram feed, envying your peers, belittling your
                      self-worth, berating God for being indifferent to your
                      suffering and procrastinating, because that&#x27;s your
                      reality- your virtual reality ! Isn&#x27;t it ? We have
                      accepted virtual reality to be our &#x27; ACTUAL
                      REALITY&#x27; ; so can we say that WHATEVER WE CHOOSE TO
                      ACCEPT BECOMES OUR REALITY ? We all have ideal versions of
                      reality in our head. Actually, reality and myth are
                      relative concepts. An idea, event, concept or product can
                      be both real and myth at the same time. It only depends on
                      the frame of reference we are looking from. So, when we
                      talk about the great epic poem , the MAHABHARATA, which is
                      one of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient India, the
                      other being the Ramayaṇa, with more than 74,000 verses,
                      plus long prose passages, or some 1.8 million words in
                      total, it is the longest epic poem in the world (roughly
                      10 times the size of the Iliad and Odyssey taken together)
                      and continuous recitation would take close to two weeks,
                      It would be better to take an ambivalent stand. The
                      historicity of the Kurukshetra War is debatable. Many
                      historians roughly estimate the date of the Kurukshetra
                      war to Iron Age India of the 10th century BCE. The setting
                      of the epic has a historical precedent in Iron Age (Vedic)
                      India, where the Kuru kingdom was the center of political
                      power during roughly 1200 to 800 BCE Puranic literature
                      presents genealogical lists associated with the
                      Mahābhārata narrative. Now, if we just do away with the
                      facts we must appreciate the relevance of this epic poem
                      even in 21st century. The central conflict of Mahabharatha
                      was vengeance. The Pandavas wanted to avenge
                      Draupadi&#x27;s humiliation &quot;cheer haran&quot;. The
                      war was a way of their redemption- a desperate attempt to
                      regain their lost souls. All the lessons by Krishna to
                      Arjun are so relevant today that we consider them as
                      guides - like the pole star to a lost traveller. The
                      central theme of the Mahabharata are envy, lust, greed ,
                      quest for power, betrayal and over ambition. Such evils
                      plague our society even today. In the Mahabharata, the
                      kins are always at daggers drawn and become blood thirsty.
                      Today, the kins brew bad blood against one other too.
                      Betrayal and greed ruin lives even today. So, we can
                      easily draw parallels between two diametrically opposite
                      timelines, can&#x27;t we ? Now, we can construct an
                      interesting theory though. Maybe, the Mahabharata happens
                      all around us, everytime ! Maybe, it is happening now,
                      while this sentence is being written. Maybe, it is a
                      microcosm of those multiverses which we know nothing about
                      ! Maybe a small version of the MAHABHARATA happens in
                      every household ! But , of course , we are bluntly
                      oblivious of its presence because we are too busy fighting
                      about the most coveted &#x27;reality vs myth debate&#x27;
                      about the Mahabharata.

                      Exploring Tamil Nadu spiritually

                      Back in the days, Tamil Nadu was ruled by many powerful
                      Hindu rulers and relatively untouched by the foreign
                      invaders. The rich heritage hence remained unmoved for
                      centuries and today, Tamilnadu is known as the “Land of
                      Temples”. It is also one of the most populated orthodox
                      Hindu states in India which can be ideal for religious
                      tourists. Home to four of the five pancha bhootha lingas,
                      there are thousands of temples to visit in Tamilnadu. Here
                      are some temples you should not miss in Tamilnadu; 1.
                      Meenakshi Amman Temple, Madurai Built by Kulashekarar
                      Pandyan as a traditional Shaivism temple. It is of great
                      mythological and historical importance as its history
                      dates back to the 1st century CE. The temple is spread
                      over 14 acres, enclosed with huge walls built to resist
                      invasions. The temple consists of shrines to other deities
                      also and has a pond called Porthamarai Kulam. It also has
                      several pillared halls, which were built in the later
                      stages, called “Mandapams”. According to a folklore,
                      Meenakshi had appeared from the Yajna as a triple breasted
                      girl and her third breast disappeared as soon she met
                      Sundareswarar (Lord Shiva). 2. Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple
                      It is the largest temple in India with the world’s tallest
                      Gopuram. Also known as Bhoologa Vaikuntam, the temple has
                      shrines dedicated to over 108 deities representing Lord
                      Vishnu. The temple which is an abode to Ranganathaswamy,
                      who is Lord Vishnu in a resting position, covers an area
                      of about 155 acres. It has withstood several attacks from
                      invaders and natural disasters over the centuries. The
                      temple also represents several architectural idioms from
                      different ages. The deities, the mandapas, the murals, the
                      inscriptions and almost every aspect of the temple throws
                      a light on the holiness of the temple. 3. Ekambareswara
                      Temple, Kanchipuram It is one of the pancha bhootha
                      sathalam, where lord Shiva represents the earth. The
                      current structure is known to be renovated by the Pallavas
                      at around 600 AD. Goddess Parvati was known to have
                      worshipped this linga as human girl ‘Kamakshi. The temple
                      has 5 courtyards named Prakarams and one temple tank
                      called Kampai Tirthai. 4. Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram
                      This was a major shrine of worship to Lord Shiva since the
                      classical period, with it’s bronze statues and stone
                      sculptures. The deity that resides here is Thillai
                      Nataraja, an important God of classical dances of south
                      India. This is also one of the pancha bhootha sathalam,
                      where Nataraja represents the sky.

                      As we are now into lockdown 4.0, some of you might now
                      feel like this is getting too. Your mind might slip into a
                      latent phase due to lack of inspiration and your body
                      might become lazier. These are times when we are stuck at
                      home with minimum human contact. An empty mind is a devils
                      workshop, so here’s how to be psychologically and
                      physically sound during quarantine. ~ensure you are in a
                      well-ventilated room and following basic self-care. This
                      might be the first step to clear your mind and all the
                      necessary thoughts. ~if you are well enough, exercise is
                      really good for mental as well as physical well-being.
                      Focusing on fitness, can also considered a hobby and now
                      that you can exercise twice a day, why not just do it?
                      Also if yoga or other traditional work out bore you, just
                      play some music and groove to the beats. Sounds cool?
                      Works even better. ~try to keep busy whether it’s chatting
                      with your friends or learning something new. It’s a great
                      time to catch up with long lost friends. Plan and set up a
                      time for a video call or something to refresh those great
                      memories. ~tell yourself ‘what i am doing is enough’. Be
                      good to yourself as no one can right now. If you still
                      don’t feel productive enough try indulging in some
                      hobbies. Remember to treat yourself. ~if you still feel
                      uneasy call for support with grief, anxiety, or mental
                      well-being issues. Make your problem known as being silent
                      is just going to make it worse. ~focus on the positives of
                      the situation instead of tensing up. Believe is good.
                      Instead of trying to concentrate on what we are missing,
                      try to focus on what we are gaining. ~Don’t forsake your
                      sleep and eat time. Set a time table and try to follow
                      that pattern. Get a professional nutritionist if you can.
                      ~Experiment; it’s indeed a great time for finding
                      yourself, isn’t it? Maybe venture into the kitchen once or
                      get those paints out. Whatever it is, try to have fun.
                      ~Whenever you are feeling anxious a trip down the memory
                      could do wonders. Go through your phone&#x27;s gallery,
                      slowly swiping through those photos reminding yourself
                      that once this is over you can get back at life. ~Write
                      about all the upsetting experiences and if possible even
                      try to track the source of it. Who knows maybe this would

                      What is real ? Is anything real at all ? Is reality a myth
                      or myth a reality ? Nothing is real and yet everything is
                      real. Sounds paradoxical ? Are you really reading this
                      article or is it a naive illusion ? Pay close attention to
                      every detail if possible ; don&#x27;t let this moment fool
                      you into believing that it is real. Because, it&#x27;s not
                      real ! If it were real you would be scrolling down your
                      Instagram feed, envying your peers, belittling your
                      self-worth, berating God for being indifferent to your
                      suffering and procrastinating, because that&#x27;s your
                      reality- your virtual reality ! Isn&#x27;t it ? We have
                      accepted virtual reality to be our &#x27; ACTUAL
                      REALITY&#x27; ; so can we say that WHATEVER WE CHOOSE TO
                      ACCEPT BECOMES OUR REALITY ? We all have ideal versions of
                      reality in our head. Actually, reality and myth are
                      relative concepts. An idea, event, concept or product can
                      be both real and myth at the same time. It only depends on
                      the frame of reference we are looking from. So, when we
                      talk about the great epic poem , the MAHABHARATA, which is
                      one of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient India, the
                      other being the Ramayaṇa, with more than 74,000 verses,
                      plus long prose passages, or some 1.8 million words in
                      total, it is the longest epic poem in the world (roughly
                      10 times the size of the Iliad and Odyssey taken together)
                      and continuous recitation would take close to two weeks,
                      It would be better to take an ambivalent stand. The
                      historicity of the Kurukshetra War is debatable. Many
                      historians roughly estimate the date of the Kurukshetra
                      war to Iron Age India of the 10th century BCE. The setting
                      of the epic has a historical precedent in Iron Age (Vedic)
                      India, where the Kuru kingdom was the center of political
                      power during roughly 1200 to 800 BCE Puranic literature
                      presents genealogical lists associated with the
                      Mahābhārata narrative. Now, if we just do away with the
                      facts we must appreciate the relevance of this epic poem
                      even in 21st century. The central conflict of Mahabharatha
                      was vengeance. The Pandavas wanted to avenge
                      Draupadi&#x27;s humiliation &quot;cheer haran&quot;. The
                      war was a way of their redemption- a desperate attempt to
                      regain their lost souls. All the lessons by Krishna to
                      Arjun are so relevant today that we consider them as
                      guides - like the pole star to a lost traveller. The
                      central theme of the Mahabharata are envy, lust, greed ,
                      quest for power, betrayal and over ambition. Such evils
                      plague our society even today. In the Mahabharata, the
                      kins are always at daggers drawn and become blood thirsty.
                      Today, the kins brew bad blood against one other too.
                      Betrayal and greed ruin lives even today. So, we can
                      easily draw parallels between two diametrically opposite
                      timelines, can&#x27;t we ? Now, we can construct an
                      interesting theory though. Maybe, the Mahabharata happens
                      all around us, everytime ! Maybe, it is happening now,
                      while this sentence is being written. Maybe, it is a
                      microcosm of those multiverses which we know nothing about
                      ! Maybe a small version of the MAHABHARATA happens in
                      every household ! But , of course , we are bluntly
                      oblivious of its presence because we are too busy fighting
                      about the most coveted &#x27;reality vs myth debate&#x27;
                      about the Mahabharata.

                      What is real ? Is anything real at all ? Is reality a myth
                      or myth a reality ? Nothing is real and yet everything is
                      real. Sounds paradoxical ? Are you really reading this
                      article or is it a naive illusion ? Pay close attention to
                      every detail if possible ; don&#x27;t let this moment fool
                      you into believing that it is real. Because, it&#x27;s not
                      real ! If it were real you would be scrolling down your
                      Instagram feed, envying your peers, belittling your
                      self-worth, berating God for being indifferent to your
                      suffering and procrastinating, because that&#x27;s your
                      reality- your virtual reality ! Isn&#x27;t it ? We have
                      accepted virtual reality to be our &#x27; ACTUAL
                      REALITY&#x27; ; so can we say that WHATEVER WE CHOOSE TO
                      ACCEPT BECOMES OUR REALITY ? We all have ideal versions of
                      reality in our head. Actually, reality and myth are
                      relative concepts. An idea, event, concept or product can
                      be both real and myth at the same time. It only depends on
                      the frame of reference we are looking from. So, when we
                      talk about the great epic poem , the MAHABHARATA, which is
                      one of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient India, the
                      other being the Ramayaṇa, with more than 74,000 verses,
                      plus long prose passages, or some 1.8 million words in
                      total, it is the longest epic poem in the world (roughly
                      10 times the size of the Iliad and Odyssey taken together)
                      and continuous recitation would take close to two weeks,
                      It would be better to take an ambivalent stand. The
                      historicity of the Kurukshetra War is debatable. Many
                      historians roughly estimate the date of the Kurukshetra
                      war to Iron Age India of the 10th century BCE. The setting
                      of the epic has a historical precedent in Iron Age (Vedic)
                      India, where the Kuru kingdom was the center of political
                      power during roughly 1200 to 800 BCE Puranic literature
                      presents genealogical lists associated with the
                      Mahābhārata narrative. Now, if we just do away with the
                      facts we must appreciate the relevance of this epic poem
                      even in 21st century. The central conflict of Mahabharatha
                      was vengeance. The Pandavas wanted to avenge
                      Draupadi&#x27;s humiliation &quot;cheer haran&quot;. The
                      war was a way of their redemption- a desperate attempt to
                      regain their lost souls. All the lessons by Krishna to
                      Arjun are so relevant today that we consider them as
                      guides - like the pole star to a lost traveller. The

                      Draupadi&#x27;s humiliation &quot;cheer haran&quot;. The
                      war was a way of their redemption- a desperate attempt to
                      regain their lost souls. All the lessons by Krishna to
                      Arjun are so relevant today that we consider them as
                      guides - like the pole star to a lost traveller. The
                      central theme of the Mahabharata are envy, lust, greed ,
                      quest for power, betrayal and over ambition. Such evils
                      plague our society even today. In the Mahabharata, the
                      kins are always at daggers drawn and become blood thirsty.
                      Today, the kins brew bad blood against one other too.
                      Betrayal and greed ruin lives even today. So, we can
                      easily draw parallels between two diametrically opposite
                      timelines, can&#x27;t we ? Now, we can construct an
                      interesting theory though. Maybe, the Mahabharata happens
                      all around us, everytime ! Maybe, it is happening now,
                      while this sentence is being written. Maybe, it is a
                      microcosm of those multiverses which we know nothing about
                      ! Maybe a small version of the MAHABHARATA happens in
                      every household ! But , of course , we are bluntly
                      oblivious of its presence because we are too busy fighting
                      about the most coveted &#x27;reality vs myth debate&#x27;
                      about the Mahabharata.

                      What is real ? Is anything real at all ? Is reality a myth

                      real. Sounds paradoxical ? Are you really reading this

                      every detail if possible ; don&#x27;t let this moment fool
                      you into believing that it is real. Because, it&#x27;s not
                      real ! If it were real you would be scrolling down your
                      Instagram feed, envying your peers, belittling your
                      self-worth, berating God for being indifferent to your
                      suffering and procrastinating, because that&#x27;s your
                      reality- your virtual reality ! Isn&#x27;t it ? We have
                      accepted virtual reality to be our &#x27; ACTUAL
                      REALITY&#x27; ; so can we say that WHATEVER WE CHOOSE TO
                      ACCEPT BECOMES OUR REALITY ? We all have ideal versions of
                      reality in our head. Actually, reality and myth are
                      relative concepts. An idea, event, concept or product can
                      be both real and myth at the same time. It only depends on
                      the frame of reference we are looking from. So, when we
                      talk about the great epic poem , the MAHABHARATA, which is
                      one of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient India, the
                      other being the Ramayaṇa, with more than 74,000 verses,
                      plus long prose passages, or some 1.8 million words in
                      total, it is the longest epic poem in the world (roughly
                      10 times the size of the Iliad and Odyssey taken together)
                      and continuous recitation would take close to two weeks,
                      It would be better to take an ambivalent stand. The
                      historicity of the Kurukshetra War is debatable. Many
                      historians roughly estimate the date of the Kurukshetra
                      war to Iron Age India of the 10th century BCE. The setting
                      of the epic has a historical precedent in Iron Age (Vedic)
                      India, where the Kuru kingdom was the center of political
                      power during roughly 1200 to 800 BCE Puranic literature
                      presents genealogical lists associated with the
                      Mahābhārata narrative. Now, if we just do away with the
                      facts we must appreciate the relevance of this epic poem
                      even in 21st century. The central conflict of Mahabharatha

                      power during roughly 1200 to 800 BCE Puranic literature
                      presents genealogical lists associated with the
                      Mahābhārata narrative. Now, if we just do away with the
                      facts we must appreciate the relevance of this epic poem
                      even in 21st century. The central conflict of Mahabharatha
                      was vengeance. The Pandavas wanted to avenge
                      Draupadi&#x27;s humiliation &quot;cheer haran&quot;. The
                      war was a way of their redemption- a desperate attempt to
                      regain their lost souls. All the lessons by Krishna to
                      Arjun are so relevant today that we consider them as
                      guides - like the pole star to a lost traveller. The
                      central theme of the Mahabharata are envy, lust, greed ,
                      quest for power, betrayal and over ambition. Such evils
                      plague our society even today. In the Mahabharata, the
                      kins are always at daggers drawn and become blood thirsty.
                      Today, the kins brew bad blood against one other too.
                      Betrayal and greed ruin lives even today. So, we can
                      easily draw parallels between two diametrically opposite
                      timelines, can&#x27;t we ? Now, we can construct an
                      interesting theory though. Maybe, the Mahabharata happens
                      all around us, everytime ! Maybe, it is happening now,
                      while this sentence is being written. Maybe, it is a
                      microcosm of those multiverses which we know nothing about
                      ! Maybe a small version of the MAHABHARATA happens in
                      every household ! But , of course , we are bluntly
                      oblivious of its presence because we are too busy fighting
                      about the most coveted &#x27;reality vs myth debate&#x27;
                      about the Mahabharata.

                      reality in our head. Actually, reality and myth are
                      relative concepts. An idea, event, concept or product can
                      be both real and myth at the same time. It only depends on
                      the frame of reference we are looking from. So, when we
                      talk about the great epic poem , the MAHABHARATA, which is
                      one of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient India, the

                      plus long prose passages, or some 1.8 million words in
                      total, it is the longest epic poem in the world (roughly
                      10 times the size of the Iliad and Odyssey taken together)
                      and continuous recitation would take close to two weeks,
                      It would be better to take an ambivalent stand. The
                      historicity of the Kurukshetra War is debatable. Many
                      historians roughly estimate the date of the Kurukshetra
                      war to Iron Age India of the 10th century BCE. The setting

                      It would be better to take an ambivalent stand. The
                      historicity of the Kurukshetra War is debatable. Many
                      historians roughly estimate the date of the Kurukshetra
                      war to Iron Age India of the 10th century BCE. The setting
                      of the epic has a historical precedent in Iron Age (Vedic)
                      India, where the Kuru kingdom was the center of political
                      power during roughly 1200 to 800 BCE Puranic literature
                      presents genealogical lists associated with the
                      Mahābhārata narrative. Now, if we just do away with the
                      facts we must appreciate the relevance of this epic poem
                      even in 21st century. The central conflict of Mahabharatha
                      was vengeance. The Pandavas wanted to avenge
                      Draupadi&#x27;s humiliation &quot;cheer haran&quot;. The
                      war was a way of their redemption- a desperate attempt to
                      regain their lost souls. All the lessons by Krishna to
                      Arjun are so relevant today that we consider them as
                      guides - like the pole star to a lost traveller. The
                      central theme of the Mahabharata are envy, lust, greed ,
                      quest for power, betrayal and over ambition. Such evils
                      plague our society even today. In the Mahabharata, the
                      kins are always at daggers drawn and become blood thirsty.
                      Today, the kins brew bad blood against one other too.
                      Betrayal and greed ruin lives even today. So, we can
                      easily draw parallels between two diametrically opposite
                      timelines, can&#x27;t we ? Now, we can construct an
                      interesting theory though. Maybe, the Mahabharata happens
                      all around us, everytime ! Maybe, it is happening now,
                      while this sentence is being written. Maybe, it is a
                      microcosm of those multiverses which we know nothing about
                      ! Maybe a small version of the MAHABHARATA happens in
                      every household ! But , of course , we are bluntly
                      oblivious of its presence because we are too busy fighting
                      about the most coveted &#x27;reality vs myth debate&#x27;
                      about the Mahabharata.

                      one of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient India, the
                      other being the Ramayaṇa, with more than 74,000 verses,
                      plus long prose passages, or some 1.8 million words in
                      total, it is the longest epic poem in the world (roughly
                      10 times the size of the Iliad and Odyssey taken together)
                      and continuous recitation would take close to two weeks,
                      It would be better to take an ambivalent stand. The
                      historicity of the Kurukshetra War is debatable. Many
                      historians roughly estimate the date of the Kurukshetra
                      war to Iron Age India of the 10th century BCE. The setting
                      of the epic has a historical precedent in Iron Age (Vedic)
                      India, where the Kuru kingdom was the center of political
                      power during roughly 1200 to 800 BCE Puranic literature
                      presents genealogical lists associated with the
                      Mahābhārata narrative. Now, if we just do away with the
                      facts we must appreciate the relevance of this epic poem
                      even in 21st century. The central conflict of Mahabharatha
                      was vengeance. The Pandavas wanted to avenge
                      Draupadi&#x27;s humiliation &quot;cheer haran&quot;. The
                      war was a way of their redemption- a desperate attempt to
                      regain their lost souls. All the lessons by Krishna to
                      Arjun are so relevant today that we consider them as
                      guides - like the pole star to a lost traveller. The
                      central theme of the Mahabharata are envy, lust, greed ,
                      quest for power, betrayal and over ambition. Such evils
                      plague our society even today. In the Mahabharata, the
                      kins are always at daggers drawn and become blood thirsty.
                      Today, the kins brew bad blood against one other too.
                      Betrayal and greed ruin lives even today. So, we can
                      easily draw parallels between two diametrically opposite
                      timelines, can&#x27;t we ? Now, we can construct an
                      interesting theory though. Maybe, the Mahabharata happens
                      all around us, everytime ! Maybe, it is happening now,
                      while this sentence is being written. Maybe, it is a
                      microcosm of those multiverses which we know nothing about
                      ! Maybe a small version of the MAHABHARATA happens in
                      every household ! But , of course , we are bluntly
                      oblivious of its presence because we are too busy fighting
                      about the most coveted &#x27;reality vs myth debate&#x27;
                      about the Mahabharata.
