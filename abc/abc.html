                      Exploring Tamil Nadu spiritually

                    <p class="card-text blogpara">
                      Back in the days, Tamil Nadu was ruled by many powerful
                      Hindu rulers and relatively untouched by the foreign
                      invaders. The rich heritage hence remained unmoved for
                      centuries and today, Tamilnadu is known as the “Land of
                      Temples”. It is also one of the most populated orthodox
                      Hindu states in India which can be ideal for religious
                      tourists. Home to four of the five pancha bhootha lingas,
                      there are thousands of temples to visit in Tamilnadu. Here
                      are some temples you should not miss in Tamilnadu; 1.
                      Meenakshi Amman Temple, Madurai Built by Kulashekarar
                      Pandyan as a traditional Shaivism temple. It is of great
                      mythological and historical importance as its history
                      dates back to the 1st century CE. The temple is spread
                      over 14 acres, enclosed with huge walls built to resist
                      invasions. The temple consists of shrines to other deities
                      also and has a pond called Porthamarai Kulam. It also has
                      several pillared halls, which were built in the later
                      stages, called “Mandapams”. According to a folklore,
                      Meenakshi had appeared from the Yajna as a triple breasted
                      girl and her third breast disappeared as soon she met
                      Sundareswarar (Lord Shiva). 2. Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple
                      It is the largest temple in India with the world’s tallest
                      Gopuram. Also known as Bhoologa Vaikuntam, the temple has
                      shrines dedicated to over 108 deities representing Lord
                      Vishnu. The temple which is an abode to Ranganathaswamy,
                      who is Lord Vishnu in a resting position, covers an area
                      of about 155 acres. It has withstood several attacks from
                      invaders and natural disasters over the centuries. The
                      temple also represents several architectural idioms from
                      different ages. The deities, the mandapas, the murals, the
                      inscriptions and almost every aspect of the temple throws
                      a light on the holiness of the temple. 3. Ekambareswara
                      Temple, Kanchipuram It is one of the pancha bhootha
                      sathalam, where lord Shiva represents the earth. The
                      current structure is known to be renovated by the Pallavas
                      at around 600 AD. Goddess Parvati was known to have
                      worshipped this linga as human girl ‘Kamakshi. The temple
                      has 5 courtyards named Prakarams and one temple tank
                      called Kampai Tirthai. 4. Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram
                      This was a major shrine of worship to Lord Shiva since the
                      classical period, with it’s bronze statues and stone
                      sculptures. The deity that resides here is Thillai
                      Nataraja, an important God of classical dances of south
                      India. This is also one of the pancha bhootha sathalam,
                      where Nataraja represents the sky.

                      As we are now into lockdown 4.0, some of you might now
                      feel like this is getting too. Your mind might slip into a
                      latent phase due to lack of inspiration and your body
                      might become lazier. These are times when we are stuck at
                      home with minimum human contact. An empty mind is a devils
                      workshop, so here’s how to be psychologically and
                      physically sound during quarantine. ~ensure you are in a
                      well-ventilated room and following basic self-care. This
                      might be the first step to clear your mind and all the
                      necessary thoughts. ~if you are well enough, exercise is
                      really good for mental as well as physical well-being.
                      Focusing on fitness, can also considered a hobby and now
                      that you can exercise twice a day, why not just do it?
                      Also if yoga or other traditional work out bore you, just
                      play some music and groove to the beats. Sounds cool?
                      Works even better. ~try to keep busy whether it’s chatting
                      with your friends or learning something new. It’s a great
                      time to catch up with long lost friends. Plan and set up a
                      time for a video call or something to refresh those great
                      memories. ~tell yourself ‘what i am doing is enough’. Be
                      good to yourself as no one can right now. If you still
                      don’t feel productive enough try indulging in some
                      hobbies. Remember to treat yourself. ~if you still feel
                      uneasy call for support with grief, anxiety, or mental
                      well-being issues. Make your problem known as being silent
                      is just going to make it worse. ~focus on the positives of
                      the situation instead of tensing up. Believe is good.
                      Instead of trying to concentrate on what we are missing,
                      try to focus on what we are gaining. ~Don’t forsake your
                      sleep and eat time. Set a time table and try to follow
                      that pattern. Get a professional nutritionist if you can.
                      ~Experiment; it’s indeed a great time for finding
                      yourself, isn’t it? Maybe venture into the kitchen once or
                      get those paints out. Whatever it is, try to have fun.
                      ~Whenever you are feeling anxious a trip down the memory
                      could do wonders. Go through your phone&#x27;s gallery,
                      slowly swiping through those photos reminding yourself
                      that once this is over you can get back at life. ~Write
                      about all the upsetting experiences and if possible even
                      try to track the source of it. Who knows maybe this would
                      make a great addition to your autobiography! ~ If you
                      already have some furry friend in your house, great! But
                      if you don’t look outside your window and try to observe
                      any life form you see. It works like introspecting and is
                      very relaxing. ~Groom your self. If you look best better
                      will feel better, call in for a hairdresser or do some
                      shopping to distract yourself occasionally. Get to
                      SheltOwn.com and find yourself a personal trainer or hair
                      dresser and find the joys of grooming. Mental health is
                      serious and being vocal about it is highly important. If
                      you feel upset or unsafe search up some relevant numbers
                      on the web and call for help. Stay home. Stay safe.

                      How To Defeat Homesickness
                    </h3>

                      After a certain age, we need to leave home for many
                      reasons; be it for college or for a job, and then we feel
                      a longing for something familiar and comfortable. Also
                      even if someone is used to staying alone any sudden memory
                      or thought can strikeout of the blue and remind them of
                      home. After the suspense and good-byes, along with and the
                      happiness and pressure of getting started in your new
                      ‘home’, it eventually crashes you. You are alone now.
                      Also, this loneliness can cause you not move out of the
                      house and thereby not make any friends. Homesickness might
                      affect emotional wellbeing and can cause anxiety and
                      sleeplessness. Here are a few tips to overcome
                      homesickness. Explore at the first chance you get. 1) If
                      need something in common with people you are going to meet
                      or if you want to find people to mingle with the key is to
                      explore what is around you. Finding cafes, malls, parks
                      and even locating grocery stores can help you a lot.
                      Discover the culture and history in your new “home away
                      from home” is to understand the place better, this can
                      also serve as the distraction from the memories. 2) Make
                      friends at the first chance you get Whether it is you
                      first day at college or work, try to socialize as much as
                      possible. Remember the other people are also interested in
                      making friends, they might be away from their home as well
                      or if they are locals, they might want to know how things
                      are back at your home place. If you are an introvert, try
                      conversing with at least one person who fits your vibe.
                      You need a friend. 3) Keep in touch with people back at
                      home. They might be missing you as much as you are missing
                      them. So instead of calling up only when you feel
                      homesick, set a time to call every day. With the onset of
                      technology, keeping in touch has become so much easier.
                      Also until you settle, keep telling someone close to you
                      how you feel every day, that way you can vent out your
                      anxiety. 4) Decorate your new home or room Add pieces and
                      the part would make you feel home. Again, the entire
                      decorating and moving process distract you from having
                      thoughts about home. 5) Think about what you are gaining
                      Recall that how far you have come, and how much you have
                      saved for the trip, the sacrifices, the time, and the
                      struggles that you have made to make it come about. All
                      this combined with the fact that you are already in place
                      from where you can progress in life, should definitely
                      help you feel better. Homesickness should be treated as an
                      initial turbulence in your voyage. It can be very sad that
                      you wake up and realise you are away from your family,
                      feeling this every day can make it harder. But keep
                      reminding yourself who you are doing this and you’ll be
                      fine.

                      &quot;Bhukhad ka pyasa man&quot; is what would translate
                      as the topic of this content.&quot;Is everyone missing the
                      Delhi street food or is it just me?&quot;, this line pops
                      in my head in a loop. All the things that I have been
                      missing, going out with my friends, eating momos, riding
                      yulu, going to India Gate and having cotton candy (which I
                      was recently enlightened by my friend it is also called
                      Budiya k Baal), roaming in conaught place and observing
                      those tik tock makers in connaught high street, nights in
                      Hauz khas where we hopped from one cafe to another for
                      free shots in, free ladies nights and danced to latest pop
                      beats, the laphing and Korean dishes we explored in majnu
                      ka tila, near north campus, bowling in Yes Minister at
                      Essex farms, going Sarojini market before 12 noon because
                      why not, then we&#x27;d get better discounts, hogging food
                      like gol gappe, parathe, choley bhature, pav bhaji chaap,
                      tandoori chicken, in chandni chowk&#x27;s lanes and
                      paharganj , R.K. ashram&#x27;s aloo tikki, samosa chat,
                      noodles and chila. My taste buds are probably shocked that
                      I haven&#x27;t tasted anything junk in almost three
                      months. The desert from Theobroma, when the chocolate in
                      the pastry has an affair with the tongue, the burger from
                      Burger king or Mc. D after a bad day in college with long
                      unbunkable class, the cheese burst pizza from dominos and
                      thin crust pizza from spezia, bistro in hudson lane, mac
                      and cheese from big yellow door, xero degree&#x27;s fries
                      and mojito are what actually makes me believe that what
                      people say &quot;comfort food&quot; is real deal. The
                      mutton and biryani from Karims&#x27; and luchi aloodum
                      from C R park and south indian dishes from sarvana bhawan
                      in janpath, udupi in kamla nagar or andra bhawan near
                      India gate, makes me feel like home every time. The boondi
                      raita that choley kulche waley bhaiya gives by adding some
                      crispy boondi on top of the glass of chilled raita, which
                      is not even in from the freezer he just takes it out from
                      a terracota pot, and nothing could ever quench the thirst
                      better than that. So many more food items that I might
                      have forgot to mention because writing this makes me so
                      overwhelmed I&#x27;m probably thinking about it but forgot
                      to mention anyhow. Delhi has made my foodie soul explore
                      so much in just three years well my first year version
                      wasn&#x27;t so much of exploring kind but I evolved into
                      this person who walks freely on the streets of Delhi, who
                      now knows people are of all different types and each one
                      is beautiful in their own way, that everyone has a
                      perspective and sometimes it blends in with others and
                      sometimes it separates like oil and water but apart from
                      all these, their busy schedule and everything everyone has
                      one thing that I have seen is common and that is love for
                      food, food that touches the bhukkad soul deep inside you.

                      people’s lives. For some it’s about what you want to be
                      said of you in the funeral and for some its about getting
                      a meal every day. So, the very first step to success is to
                      define your success. After you define it, you need to work
                      on it and to work on it you need some skills to sharpen
                      your work. By the way, have you thought about what are the
                      skills that we don’t need to be successful? This is called
                      perspective. You need to have your own point of view which
                      means that while reading this article you don’t need to
                      follow it blindly, put up your own thoughts in it and then
                      follow it. The basic of success is to have a resolve. Is
                      resolve a skill? Yes, because anyone can have it and not
                      everyone makes it. So, let’s begin. • Planning skills – if
                      you are not good at decision making then why not plan it.
                      Start by planning to get up, before you go to sleep.
                      Planning is important. You should plan your day, your
                      work, your food menu and everything you live with. That’s
                      the backbone of discipline. Although it is said that
                      discipline is backbone of any skill. In philosophical
                      terms, unplanned journey is the best but you must also be
                      panned for unplanned. The next is • Resilience –
                      resiliency is toughness, the ability to keep going on.
                      Whenever you start something, you always start from the
                      beginning and its very common to get failed, that’s where
                      resilience comes under action. Next is • Leadership skills
                      – Who’s in higher demand, the people that are leading
                      others or those that are being led? Leaders are leaders
                      and obviously you’re going to be more successful at what
                      you do if you develop your leadership skills. •
                      Observation skills – a good observation is absolutely
                      crucial in order to become successful. You’re able to
                      understand the environment and situation that you’re in,
                      and be able to react and adapt to it much more quickly. It
                      provides you with a lot more opportunities because you’re
                      able to see things before other people do. Learn to be
                      observant. • Communication skills – without communication
                      there is no source of contact. The way of communication is
                      very much important. It will help you in negotiation. Lack
                      of communication can cause you a lot of mistakes. •
                      Imagination – this is the reason why human society keep on
                      developing. It’s important because when you have friends,
                      family and even acquaintances telling you that things are
                      not possible, and you should just get a regular job,
                      regular house and have a family, then you need to have a
                      great imagination to be able to block these voices out and
                      still believe that your dream is possible. There are a lot
                      of more skills which you must learn and realize, those are
                      – the ability to relate others, ability to trust others,
                      knowing how to keep and when to show empathy, active
                      listening skills, flexibility, good judgement, the ability
                      to keep yourself open minded and many more. Most important
                      thing is that you need to be honest with yourself. You
                      have a lot of unrealized potential hidden in you. Go for
                      it and make it yours.

                      The day I stepped into my college&#x27;s &#x27;girls
                      hostel&#x27;, I never knew I would end up with a bag full
                      of memories of every sort. Specially the strange, dramatic
                      yet funniest Halloween ever. So, the day was not very
                      different, just usual like any other day. Our batch of
                      second year students were barred from attending the hostel
                      Diwali function, don&#x27;t even ask why, we were not very
                      famous for good conduct moreover the whole batch stuck
                      together so eventually no one from second year went apart
                      from participants and few others. We did miss on the
                      function but our batch decided to celebrate our own
                      Halloween and we planned that at midnight all of us would
                      get dressed up and go to each and every room and do the
                      usual trick or treat. That is the time when we all got
                      excited with the plan and everyone started planning on
                      getting dressed up. Though my roommates and I were not
                      that interested but looking at everyone getting all
                      dressed up we planned to get ready and go with others.
                      Everyone got dressed up, a girl got too innovative and got
                      dressed up as Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Caribbean
                      and she even had an alcohol bottle, don&#x27;t ask where
                      she got it from, we were in hostel, I hopes that explains
                      itself, one got dressed up like Annabelle and I must say
                      it was pretty much on point. Similarly, there were many
                      who could pass the best ghost bar easily. I had no idea
                      what to dress up like I slowly started putting make up and
                      ended up looking like the giant in Jajantaram Mamantaram.
                      Then I realized what a terrible idea it was when I could
                      have just put some kajal and looked like I got punched,
                      but no what a decision I taken lie any other life
                      decisions of mine, there was no going back because there
                      were others who looked scarier than me so I had company
                      and didn&#x27;t feel sorry. We all took a group picture
                      till then almost everyone on the first floor, our seniors
                      and our batch mates had seen us and a ruckus had already
                      been initiated by our batch. Few of our batch mates were
                      not interested so they decided to stay in their own rooms.
                      Then we went down stairs to our juniors we got split into
                      two parties few went to rooms on one side of the lobby and
                      few went towards the rooms near the mess area. That is
                      when things went out of control. We all got driven in the
                      moment and there was a huge commotion. All of us were
                      shouting, laughing running here and there. Then the hostel
                      Superintendent entered through the door, which connected
                      the passage for first year&#x27;s rooms and her room. We
                      were all tensed and few rushed upstairs to their rooms and
                      few were left behind in the rooms of our juniors. Everyone
                      switched their lights off and pretended to be asleep.
                      Wondering where I was? Yes, I was downstairs in one of the
                      junior&#x27;s rooms with few of my friends. The
                      superintendent slowly walked up to the first floor and we
                      were all scared to be caught in such weirdly dressed up
                      manner. We slowly went up through the back door passage
                      and washed our faces and went to our room but
                      unfortunately she had caught few of us and was asking them
                      whoever was involved but didn&#x27;t get caught, so I had
                      to go, I knew no one would have told her but we had to
                      face the consequences together. The Superintendent clicked
                      our pictures as a proof and that was when I came to know
                      she had found the alcohol bottle near the stair case and
                      on top of one issue about creating a huge disturbance in
                      midnight, we were also caught for a bigger monkey
                      business. Though one of us was spontaneous enough to tell
                      that they had brought the empty bottle to paint for some
                      project yet we weren&#x27;t that lucky so she didn&#x27;t
                      buy our full proof excuse. She told us that she would
                      inform this to the college director and we would have to
                      write an application saying sorry and that if anything
                      else would happen further we would be expelled from the
                      hostel and we would have to call our local guardians and
                      she wouldn&#x27;t sign our clearance for admit card until
                      we did as told. It was like a cloud of sadness had fell on
                      everyone. All of us told our parents then itself before it
                      could get any worse, luckily our parents and local
                      guardians didn&#x27;t take it so badly so we were a bit
                      relieved. But that day will always be remembered by all of
                      us.

                      He had so many wives but he buried &quot;her&quot; near
                      Yamuna river using the best of all white marble with best
                      of all architecture maybe that is how he expressed
                      himself. Few months back me and my friends decided to go
                      and visit Agra, though I had been there twice before, I
                      was up for it after all it would be fun going with
                      friends. After loads of planning and convincing each ones
                      parents 9 of us girls were all set to have fun in Agra. So
                      skipping all the unnecessary details I would like to give
                      you an itinerary with which you can rock your trip in two
                      days like we did. We took a train from New Delhi at the
                      evening which took us to Agra. We crashed in a cottage
                      like home stay which was in outskirts so we could
                      experience village like and we did indeed. The cottage was
                      like kacha house and had lalteen n all stuff. That night
                      we listened to music smoked some green, danced and talked
                      and dozed off. The next day, as usual we all have that one
                      friend who takes the initiative and wakes everyone up and
                      we all woke up and got ready to stay our day. We went to
                      &quot;Deviram&#x27;s&quot; to stuff some yummy &#x27;bedai
                      aloo&#x27; and &#x27;jalebi&#x27; which was bliss in the
                      morning and a lovely way to start the trip. After all nine
                      tummies were satisfied we went to see well of course, Taj
                      Mahal. It was my third time visiting that place but its
                      alway fun to look at its beauty and be proud that our
                      nation has one of the eight wonders in the world. The
                      architecture is mesmerizing and reflects so much on our
                      rich history. Then we rushed a bit since we had lots of
                      places to cover and hurried towards Agra Fort which was
                      amazing. The entrance had a slope with tall walls on both
                      the sides and it was like walking uphill, then one of my
                      friend told that they had built these type of entrances so
                      that if some enemy enters the premises they would pour hot
                      oil on the floor and it would prevent the entry. We walked
                      in and saw &#x27;Diwan-e-aam and Diwan-e-khas&#x27; and we
                      all took time and appreciated the directors and art
                      directors of the movie &#x27;Jodha Akbar&#x27; for making
                      it so realistic. After that we went to see
                      &quot;Itmad-ud-Daulah&quot; which the auto driver was
                      adamant to call it &#x27;baby taj&#x27; and when we
                      reached we actually realized it was a smaller and was like
                      downloading a lite version of Taj Mahal. Then we went to
                      see the &#x27;Tomb of Akbar&#x27; and it was beautiful.
                      looking at the beautiful craftsmanship and architecture I
                      was awestruck. Then we went to &#x27;Mehtab Bagh&#x27; it
                      was basically an exquisite and huge garden from where we
                      could see the Taj mahal, it had a view, like at the end of
                      the garden the Taj Mahal started. Till this point we all
                      were hungry so we went to a cafe and hogged some paste and
                      pizzas. Then we went to see &#x27;Sikandra fort&#x27;
                      because it was almost 3pm and we couldn&#x27;t make it to
                      &#x27;Fatehpur Sikri&#x27;. I personally loved Sikandra
                      Fort as it was beautiful and it had so many animals around
                      like deer, different birds squirrels and just sitting
                      there and looking at the monument and the garden was so
                      serine and peaceful. After sikandra fort we were all
                      pretty tired but we decided to go to Sadar Bazar and
                      luckily we went there we had amazing street food like
                      tikki, gol gapppe, rolls, kulfi, chaat, infact sadar bazar
                      had a whole gali called &quot;chaat gali&quot;. Well we
                      got back to the home stay and went to sleep as we were all
                      tired walking and touring all day and we had to catch
                      train early in the morning. We couldn&#x27;t make it to
                      Fatehpur Sikri but if you want you can plan it for next
                      day and plan a two day trip we couldn&#x27;t as we had to
                      return in a day everyone had classes, life of an undergrad
                      student. Long story in short we had loads of fun and made
                      loads of memories which we all would cherish for life.

                      Gobi Desert: Find solace in the sand.
                    </h3>
                    <h5 class="blogdate">Aug 26, 2020 | 2 minutes read</h5>
                    <h5 class="blogdate">Abc</h5>
                    <p class="card-text blogpara">
                      The Gobi desert can best be described as desert savannah
                      which extends from southern Mongolia to northern China.
                      Graced with historic sites, stunning views and plenty to
                      do for tourists, it projects extreme temperatures, from
                      the scorching heat in the day to the chilly nights. The
                      flaming cliffs, ice valley and the forest of giant rocks
                      are a few places to visit in this place. Though there are
                      several blogs and pictures of this picturesque desert, the
                      camera doesn&#x27;t even come close to capturing its real
                      beauty. See for yourselves what you are going to call the
                      best sunrises at the slopes of sand and the best sunsets
                      at the cliffs of flame. Then we have the nomads and the
                      animals of the desert who have to constantly battle these
                      rough conditions and yet have accepted this place as their
                      home. They and their ancestors had been living in the Gobi
                      desert for years herding a lot of animals like camels and
                      goats. The incredibly fluffy two-humped camels could show
                      you around the dunes and as there are really slow there is
                      no need to worry about motion sickness. In the Gobi desert
                      both the colour green of the grass and browns of the sand
                      can be found on the same day. You can start the morning in
                      endless plains, find yourself self trudging through a
                      narrow canyon in the afternoon and end your day in some
                      sparkly sand dunes. Imagine the amount of exploration you
                      can do of both yourself and the nature, facing an endless
                      steppe and sun falling in the horizon. Travellers who
                      visit say that it&#x27;s a wonderful place which provides
                      a life-changing experience. A perfect treat for history
                      buffs; whether you are into archaeology or palaeontology
                      this is your go-to place. Climbing the sand dunes is hard,
                      you have to take several tiny little steps. Huffing and
                      puffing, wondering if you are even progressing, you reach
                      the top to meet with an incredible sight and realise it
                      was worth it. This is the place where stories are born,
                      imaginations go wild, beautiful photos are taken and
                      fearless humans originate. You can take a vehicle for the
                      overall travel but there some places which need to be on
                      foot. All the sweat, thirst and toil results in a string
                      of beautiful memories with the vividly fascinating
                      background of the desert. The land of blue skies and
                      sprawling sands is the perfect place to find yourself.

                      &quot;We enjoy the journey more than the destination.”
                      This was the first time I went to another state. From
                      Gujarat to Maharashtra I boarded in the Train from
                      Ahmedabad to Pune. I reached Pune station. Heavy rain was
                      going on still heavy traffic. The first experienced with
                      the oxford of the east city “Pune” was unpleasant. I took
                      the bus for my hostel where I was enrolled for my 1st year
                      of PGDM. I reached the hostel and only know one person
                      because we were on the same telegram group, we talked on
                      the phone that was how I know him just by voice. Later, I
                      made good friends in the hostel which turned into family.
                      We were 11 people in our group. we were planning for
                      hangout, we searched on the internet like everyone does
                      nowadays “different places to hangout in Pune” Hahaha. The
                      first place came was Sinhagad, so we planned for the same.
                      The question came into our mind “how to travel there?” All
                      said by bike because nowadays every youngster loves to
                      travel by bike. Then we visited different shops “where we
                      will get the reasonable price bike on rent”. In the end,
                      we choose one rented bike shop it was very small. We doubt
                      that shop because they did not have proper documentation
                      for the bikes, and we needed 5 bikes. Somehow, the bike
                      owner convinced us, and we took those bikes. But after a
                      few minutes my two-friend caught up by police personnel
                      because they drove on the wrong side as well as they did
                      not wear a helmet also, they did not have all
                      documentation for the bike. Police personnel demanded 2000
                      bucks for it. However, after half-hour discussion with
                      them in the end they gave 500 bucks. Then we all were met
                      in the night and we were making fun of them like every
                      bachelor group does. The next morning, the weather was
                      very cool. we woke up at 5:00 am still we left our hostel
                      at 7:00 am because every group has one or two lazy people
                      who always late in every situation. So, we have a few
                      people in our group as well. Then we went for selfie click
                      because “memories bhi chahiye na” But almost 10 minutes we
                      blocked the road for just selfie purpose. People were
                      looking at us like we were coming from another planet.
                      Then we took breakfast and went for Sinhagad but on the
                      road, my 2-friend met an accident and at the same time
                      police personnel were there. We all said in our mind shit
                      we didn’t have documents of the bike we all were afraid
                      our heartbeat at a peak, but police personnel came and
                      asked my 2 friend “are you well? and they leave the place
                      ”. Then they both had taken first aid and our heartbeat
                      came to normal. After a few minutes, we moved ahead for
                      the Sinhagad we reached there. The atmosphere was very
                      cold and stormy on the hill. we all had first time
                      experienced that kind of atmosphere on the top of the hill
                      only clouds were there. It was felt like “Jannat”. Then
                      after having some snacks over their we returned to our
                      hostel. Great experienced for me because of so many dramas
                      happened in the trip, but still one the most memorable
                      journey for me.

                      Let Greece take over. Greece is a small southern European
                      country located between Albania and Turkey. It is
                      essentially a mountainous area completely surrounded by
                      the Mediterranean Sea and is known for its profound
                      history, scenic locations, friendly locals and long hot
                      summers. Mykonos is a famous spot in Greece recognized for
                      its picturesque beaches and party scenes. You can have
                      amazing food and drinks served here as the waves hit your
                      feet and the sand becomes your seat. Ionian islands have a
                      number of popular destinations like the Corfu island, also
                      known as the emerald island, and the Zante island which is
                      home to the world-famous Navagio beach. Other than the
                      party culture and beautiful beaches, Zakynthos is known
                      for the Carretta sea turtles and parks harbouring various
                      marine creatures. The country’s food is something you
                      would grow fond of, they make oil-based food and draw on
                      traditional recipes with a twist. The most intriguing
                      thing is the number of hours spent in the kitchen to make
                      this food and the ability to bond over it. Then we have
                      the Papafragas beach and Caves, after Kapros, which
                      consist of small sandy beaches that are off the beaten
                      path, this is another ideal landscape in Milos. The
                      hovering rocks of Papafragas pave a small gap to the
                      salt-fine sandy shore which is an extraordinary spot for
                      clicking pictures. The Acropolis of Athens is definitely a
                      place for all the history enthusiasts who would love to
                      see the place where almost everything in ancient Greece
                      seemed to happen and while you are at it, make it a point
                      to visit the Acropolis Museum. Cyclades islands make up
                      some of the most used locations for Bollywood movies, with
                      its whitewashed houses and narrow paths. The glamour of
                      cliff-top monasteries and stunning mountain arrays can
                      easily inspire a tour to Meteora. Then there is Kavala in
                      the North of Greece which has several 15th-century forts
                      and castles, some of which even hold cultural fests and
                      performances over the year. All in all, Greece is a
                      beautiful place to be visited, remembered and cherished.
