                The day I stepped into my college&#x27;s &#x27;girls
                hostel&#x27;, I never knew I would end up with a bag full of
                memories of every sort. Specially the strange, dramatic yet
                funniest Halloween ever. <br />So, the day was not very
                different, just usual like any other day. Our batch of second
                year students were barred from attending the hostel Diwali
                function, don&#x27;t even ask why, we were not very famous for
                good conduct moreover the whole batch stuck together so
                eventually no one from second year went apart from participants
                and few others. We did miss on the function but our batch
                decided to celebrate our own Halloween and we planned that at
                midnight all of us would get dressed up and go to each and every
                room and do the usual trick or treat. That is the time when we
                all got excited with the plan and everyone started planning on
                getting dressed up. Though my roommates and I were not that
                interested but looking at everyone getting all dressed up we
                planned to get ready and go with others. Everyone got dressed
                up, a girl got too innovative and got dressed up as Jack Sparrow
                from Pirates of the Caribbean and she even had an alcohol
                bottle, don&#x27;t ask where she got it from, we were in hostel,
                I hopes that explains itself, one got dressed up like Annabelle
                and I must say it was pretty much on point. Similarly, there
                were many who could pass the best ghost bar easily. I had no
                idea what to dress up like I slowly started putting make up and
                ended up looking like the giant in Jajantaram Mamantaram. Then I
                realized what a terrible idea it was when I could have just put
                some kajal and looked like I got punched, but no what a decision
                I taken lie any other life decisions of mine, there was no going
                back because there were others who looked scarier than me so I
                had company and didn&#x27;t feel sorry. We all took a group
                picture till then almost everyone on the first floor, our
                seniors and our batch mates had seen us and a ruckus had already
                been initiated by our batch. Few of our batch mates were not
                interested so they decided to stay in their own rooms.
                <br />Then we went down stairs to our juniors we got split into
                two parties few went to rooms on one side of the lobby and few
                went towards the rooms near the mess area. That is when things
                went out of control. We all got driven in the moment and there
                was a huge commotion. All of us were shouting, laughing running
                here and there. Then the hostel Superintendent entered through
                the door, which connected the passage for first year&#x27;s
                rooms and her room. We were all tensed and few rushed upstairs
                to their rooms and few were left behind in the rooms of our
                juniors. Everyone switched their lights off and pretended to be
                asleep. Wondering where I was? Yes, I was downstairs in one of
                the junior&#x27;s rooms with few of my friends. The
                superintendent slowly walked up to the first floor and we were
                all scared to be caught in such weirdly dressed up manner. We
                slowly went up through the back door passage and washed our
                faces and went to our room but unfortunately she had caught few
                of us and was asking them whoever was involved but didn&#x27;t
                get caught, so I had to go, I knew no one would have told her
                but we had to face the consequences together. The Superintendent
                clicked our pictures as a proof and that was when I came to know
                she had found the alcohol bottle near the stair case and on top
                of one issue about creating a huge disturbance in midnight, we
                were also caught for a bigger monkey business. Though one of us
                was spontaneous enough to tell that they had brought the empty
                bottle to paint for some project yet we weren&#x27;t that lucky
                so she didn&#x27;t buy our full proof excuse. She told us that
                she would inform this to the college director and we would have
                to write an application saying sorry and that if anything else
                would happen further we would be expelled from the hostel and we
                would have to call our local guardians and she wouldn&#x27;t
                sign our clearance for admit card until we did as told.<br />It
                was like a cloud of sadness had fell on everyone. All of us told
                our parents then itself before it could get any worse, luckily
                our parents and local guardians didn&#x27;t take it so badly so
                we were a bit relieved. But that day will always be remembered
                by all of us.
